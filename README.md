# Battleship 2184

## Object Oriented Programming

### Description
```bash
The year is 2184 and the world is on the brink of a new ice age. 
Battleship is a game that has been played for many years after the 
Great Nuclear War and is a test of skill, strategy, and luck. 

The only surviving copy of this legendary game was 
found in an old PC Terminal, before the dark ages.
```

This is a player versus player (PvP) Battleship game implemented in C#. The game is played on a 10x10 grid. At the start of the game, each player has 3 ships placed randomly on their grid. Players take turns guessing the coordinates on the opponent's grid in an attempt to sink their ships. Each player has 20 guesses to sink all of their opponent's ships. 

It consists of two versions:
- OOP: Object Oriented Programming
- Functional: Functional Programming

The idea of this assignment is to implement the same game using both paradigms and compare the results.

### Diagrams

For a detailed diagram of how the classes and their relationships were implemented, please see the detailed [diagram documentation](diagrams/Diagram.md).

### Compiling and running

Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine
```bash
dotnet --version
```
For VSCode setup, follow the instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/dotnet#_setting-up-vs-code-for-net-development).

Run the program with:
```bash
./run.sh
```
